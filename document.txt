### **Abstract (Page 2)**

This project presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a decentralized platform for the trading of carbon credits, built upon the Ethereum blockchain. The current carbon market is plagued by issues of opacity, high transaction costs, and the risk of fraud, such as double-spending. To address these challenges, this project leverages blockchain technology to create a transparent, secure, and efficient marketplace. The system utilizes Solidity smart contracts to define carbon credits as ERC-20 tokens and to govern the marketplace logic. A Vue.js-based web application provides a user-friendly interface for various stakeholders—Regulators, Validators, Generators, and Consumers—to interact with the ecosystem. The result is a proof-of-concept that demonstrates the viability of blockchain in enhancing the integrity and accessibility of environmental markets, effectively eliminating intermediaries and providing an immutable ledger for all transactions.
